## Idea :bulb:	
This project is all about beer.
The user is offered information (tagline, image, brewed date, bitterness, food pairing, alchocol percentage) about various beers from around the world.
If the user hesitates what beer to drink tonight he is offered a random beer selection.
## Technologies used :desktop_computer:	
The application is created using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript. The api used for getting the beer information is https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2.
